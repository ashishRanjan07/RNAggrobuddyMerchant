  problem:
    'Farmers don’t receive convenient prices of the cultivated crops.\nThe merchant is not able to know the exact price of the farmer’s products due to broker.\nBroker takes benefits from the both sides.\nEvery time the Broker wouldn’t be present to communicate merchant with the farmer.\nThe problem of merchant regarding unavailability of workers for associate works.\nDue to communication gap between farmer and the merchant,farmer finds difficulty in knowing the demand of products in market.',
  solution:
    'Farmer will get authentic price for their cultivated products by using the application.\nAs merchant will have direct communication with the farmers, it will give rise to transparency in the rate of the crops.\nBy using this application the system of the brokery will get reduced to some extent.\nWhenever the merchant wishes to communicate with the customer / farmer, a direct link would get set up between them.\nThe motive of the app is to create a positive and trusted relationship between farmer and the merchant.\nIt will also make farmers aware of the market demand of their crops.\nAll the above solution can be given by Developing a good platform in which they can get better facility.',
